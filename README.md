## Text Classification using USE

In this project I have used USE(Universal Sentence Encoder) to generate embeddings of the comments in the dataset. 


A Neural Network with custom architecture was used.

The text can be either positive negative or neutral.

To run this project.

First install required things

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can run the interface.py file directly.

```bash
python interface.py
```

The first run might take time as the USE is downloaded and saved in the cache, further  it will run smooth.
